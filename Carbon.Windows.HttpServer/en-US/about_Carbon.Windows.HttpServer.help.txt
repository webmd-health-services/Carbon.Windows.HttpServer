# Overview

The Carbon.Windows.HttpServer module contains functions for configuring HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificate bindings on IP
addresses and ports. Processes can't use an HTTPS certificate unless that certificate has been bound to a IP address and
port combination. Use this module's `Get-CHttpsCertificateBinding`, `Remove-CHttpsCertificateBinding`,
`Set-CHttpsCertificateBinding`, and `Test-CHttpsCertificateBinding` functions to configure HTTPS certificate bindings.
